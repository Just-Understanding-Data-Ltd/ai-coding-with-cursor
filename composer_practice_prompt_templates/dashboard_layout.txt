1. I want you to generate a dashboard layout, i.e. a navigation side bar and a main content area.
2. The side bar should have a logo at the top, and icons when it is smaller, then words when it is larger
3. The user should be able to collapse and expand the side bar
4. The main content area should take up the remaining space
5. The main content area should have a header with a title and a subtitle
6. It should contain a user profile icon in the top right corner which shows a dropdown menu when clicked, and a sign out button, there should be a default image if the user does not have a profile picture
