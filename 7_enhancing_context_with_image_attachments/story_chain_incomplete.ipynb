    "This LangChain story generator chain creates a complete story by sequentially generating and chaining together various story elements. The process starts with character creation, moves on to plot development, and then generates individual scenes. Each step in the chain builds upon the output of the previous steps, ensuring a coherent and interconnected narrative.\n",

    "## Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Character Generator\n",
    "   - Input: Basic story premise or theme\n",
    "   - Output: List of main characters with descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Plot Outline Generator\n",
    "   - Input: Characters from step 1 and story premise\n",
    "   - Output: High-level plot outline with major story beats\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scene List Generator\n",
    "   - Input: Plot outline from step 2\n",
    "   - Output: List of scenes with brief descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scene Detail Generator\n",
    "   - Input: Individual scene descriptions from step 3\n",
    "   - Output: Detailed scene content including dialogue and action\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Story Compiler\n",
    "   - Input: All generated scenes from step 4\n",
    "   - Output: Complete story with proper formatting and structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user provides a basic story premise or theme.\n",
    "2. The Character Generator creates a cast of main characters.\n",
    "3. The Plot Outline Generator uses the characters and premise to create a high-level story structure.\n",
    "4. The Scene List Generator breaks down the plot into individual scenes.\n",
    "5. The Scene Detail Generator expands each scene with full content.\n",
    "6. The Story Compiler combines all the generated content into a final, cohesive story.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chain allows for a structured and systematic approach to story creation, with each component building upon the previous ones to ensure consistency and coherence in the final output."
