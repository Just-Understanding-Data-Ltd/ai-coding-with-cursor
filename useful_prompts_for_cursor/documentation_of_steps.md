Generate a detailed list of documentation tasks for a web application project, focusing on the core elements needed to ship the product. Include tasks for documenting:

1. Application routes and their purposes
2. Page layouts and content requirements
3. Reusable components and their props
4. State management approach
5. API endpoints and their expected responses
6. Authentication and authorization mechanisms
7. Database schema and relationships
8. Environment setup and configuration
9. Build and deployment processes
10. Third-party integrations

Format the output as a markdown-compatible task list, with main categories and subtasks where appropriate. Save this list to a file named "app_documentation_tasks.md" without any additional content or formatting.
