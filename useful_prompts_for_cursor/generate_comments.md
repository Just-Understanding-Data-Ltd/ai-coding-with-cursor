I want you to generate comments and explain my code as you write it. The idea behind this is to improve code base indexing as the LLM will have more context about the code as you write it.

Follow the following rules:

- Generate comments for each function and class.
- Generate comments for critical parts of the code, like the main logic, loops, and conditionals.
- Generate inline and multi-line comments.

You must explain exactly what the code is doing and why.
