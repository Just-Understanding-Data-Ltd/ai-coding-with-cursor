# stripe.txt - Stripe Integration Specification

## Overview
Implement Stripe payment processing on the FastAPI backend to handle subscriptions, one-time payments, and manage customer information. Use a single webhook to handle all Stripe events and update the database accordingly.

## Components

[...previous sections remain the same...]

### 7. Webhook Handling
- Endpoint: POST /stripe/webhook
- Functionality:
  - Handle all Stripe events in a single webhook
  - Implement robust error handling and logging
  - Update local database based on webhook events
  - Ensure idempotency to handle duplicate events

#### 7.1 Webhook Setup
- Configure the webhook URL in the Stripe dashboard
- Set up webhook signing secret for enhanced security
- Implement Stripe signature verification

#### 7.2 Event Handling
Implement handlers for the following event types (non-exhaustive list):
- `customer.created`
- `customer.updated`
- `customer.deleted`
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `invoice.paid`
- `invoice.payment_failed`
- `charge.succeeded`
- `charge.failed`
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `payment_intent.payment_failed`
- `payment_method.attached`
- `payment_method.detached`

#### 7.3 Database Updates
For each event type, implement corresponding database updates:
- Update customer information
- Create/update/cancel subscriptions
- Record successful payments
- Flag failed payments for follow-up
- Update payment method information

#### 7.4 Error Handling
- Implement try-except blocks for each event type
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Implement a retry mechanism for failed database updates

#### 7.5 Logging
- Log all received events with timestamp and event type
- Log the result of database updates (success/failure)
- Ensure PCI compliance in logging practices (no sensitive data logged)

#### 7.6 Testing
- Create unit tests for each event handler
- Implement integration tests using Stripe's test mode
- Test various scenarios (successful payments, failed payments, subscription changes, etc.)
- Use Stripe's webhook test events for comprehensive coverage

#### 7.7 Monitoring
- Implement monitoring for webhook failures
- Set up alerts for critical event processing errors

### 8. Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling for Stripe API calls
- Create custom exception classes for different Stripe-related errors
- Ensure all errors are logged with appropriate detail

### 9. Logging
- Log all Stripe-related actions and events
- Ensure PCI compliance in logging practices
- Implement structured logging for easy parsing and analysis

### 10. Testing
- Implement unit tests for all Stripe-related functions
- Create integration tests using Stripe's test mode
- Test various scenarios (successful payments, failed payments, subscription changes, etc.)
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical payment flows

### 11. Security
- Securely store Stripe API keys using environment variables
- Implement Stripe signature verification for webhooks
- Ensure all Stripe-related routes are properly authenticated
- Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

### 12. Caching
- Implement caching for frequently accessed Stripe data (e.g., subscription plans)
- Use cache invalidation strategies based on webhook events

### 13. Stripe Checkout Integration
- Implement Stripe Checkout for a quick and easy payment flow
- Create endpoints to generate Checkout sessions

### 14. Reporting
- Create endpoints for generating financial reports
- Implement data aggregation for revenue analytics
- Ensure reporting data is updated based on webhook events

### 15. Refunds
- Endpoint: POST /stripe/refunds
- Functionality:
  - Process full or partial refunds
  - Update database based on refund-related webhook events

### 16. Documentation
- Create detailed API documentation for all Stripe-related endpoints
- Document the webhook integration process and event handling
- Provide examples of payload structures for different event types

### 17. Stripe Connect (if applicable)
- Implement Stripe Connect for marketplace or multi-party payments
- Handle account creation and verification processes
- Update connected account information based on webhook events

### 18. Compliance
- Ensure compliance with Stripe's usage agreements
- Implement necessary checks for restricted businesses or high-risk transactions
- Keep track of and respond to regulatory changes affecting payment processing

### 19. Performance Optimization
- Implement asynchronous processing for webhook events
- Use database transactions to ensure data consistency
- Optimize database queries for high-volume events

### 20. Scalability
- Design the webhook handler to be stateless for easy horizontal scaling
- Implement a queue system for processing high volumes of events
- Consider using a separate microservice for Stripe event processing if needed
