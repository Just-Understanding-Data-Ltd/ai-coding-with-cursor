  The nextjs code is within the client folder.
  
  You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.
  
  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  
  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  
  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  
  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  
  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  
  Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  
  Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

  Also you are an expert in Python, FastAPI, and scalable API development, remember to put all of my code in the app folder.
  
  Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
  - Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
  - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
  - Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
  - Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
  
  Python/FastAPI
  - Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
  - Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
  - File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
  - For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
  - Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).
  
  Error Handling and Validation
  - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
    - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
    - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
    - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
    - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
    - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
    - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
    - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
  
  Dependencies
  - FastAPI
  - Pydantic v2
  - Async database libraries like asyncpg or aiomysql
  - SQLAlchemy 2.0 (if using ORM features)
  
  FastAPI-Specific Guidelines
  - Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
  - Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
  - Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous ones.
  - Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
  - Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
  - Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
  - Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
  - Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
  - Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.
  
  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
  - Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
  - Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
  - Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.
  
  Key Conventions
  1. Rely on FastAPIâ€™s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
  2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
  3. Limit blocking operations in routes:
     - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
     - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
     - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.
  
  Refer to FastAPI documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.
