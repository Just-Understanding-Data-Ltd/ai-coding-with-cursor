## Key Learnings

1. **SQL Migration Organization Pattern**

   ```sql
   # File Naming Convention
   YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_[type]_[action]_[subject]_[modifier].sql

   # Types
   sys_ - System RPCs (REQUIRED)
   enum_ - Enumerations
   tbl_ - Tables
   trg_ - Triggers
   rls_ - RLS policies
   fn_ - Functions
   idx_ - Indexes
   ```

2. **RPC and RLS Policy Colocations**

   ```sql
   -- Example: 20240124000001_sys_create_user.sql
   -- 1. Function definition
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sys_create_user() ...

   -- 2. Permissions
   GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION sys_create_user TO authenticated;

   -- 3. RLS policies (REQUIRED to be in same file)
   CREATE POLICY "Users can execute sys_create_user" ON ...
   ```

3. **Table Creation Best Practices**

   ```sql
   -- Tables include their indexes
   CREATE TABLE users (...);

   -- Group indexes together
   CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
   CREATE INDEX idx_users_status ON users(status);

   -- Triggers after indexes
   CREATE TRIGGER update_users_timestamp ...
   ```

4. **App Layout Organization**
   ```typescript
   // Structured layout hierarchy
   app / application / org / [orgId] / [teamId] / layout.tsx; // Team-specific layout
   page.tsx; // Team dashboard
   error.tsx; // Error handling
   ```

## Key Achievements

1. **Migration Restructuring**

   - Split monolithic migrations into focused, single-responsibility files
   - Established clear naming conventions and file organization
   - Separated blog, organization, and invitation migrations

2. **Style Guide Creation**

   - Created comprehensive SQL migration style guide
   - Defined strict rules for RPC naming and policy organization
   - Established best practices for table creation and indexing

3. **Code Organization**

   - Implemented logical ordering of migrations
   - Grouped related functionality together
   - Improved maintainability through consistent structure

4. **Application Architecture Improvements**
   - Restructured app layout for better organization management
   - Enhanced team features within organizations
   - Improved RPC functions for invitation system
   - Added error handling for team-specific routes

## Key Challenges and How They Were Overcome

1. **Migration Dependencies**

   - Challenge: Ensuring correct execution order with split migrations
   - Solution: Implemented timestamp-based ordering and documented dependencies

2. **RLS Policy Organization**

   - Challenge: Deciding where to place RLS policies
   - Solution: Established rule to keep function-specific policies with their functions

3. **File Organization**

   - Challenge: Balancing granularity with maintainability
   - Solution: Created clear prefixes and modifiers for different types of migrations

4. **Team Management Integration**
   - Challenge: Integrating team features within existing org structure
   - Solution: Implemented nested dynamic routes with proper error boundaries

## Key Next Steps

1. **Migration Testing**

   - Test the new migration structure with fresh database
   - Verify all RLS policies work as expected
   - Ensure correct execution order

2. **Documentation**

   - Add examples for common migration patterns
   - Create templates for different migration types
   - Document rollback procedures

3. **Tooling**

   - Consider creating migration file generators
   - Add linting for migration naming conventions
   - Implement automated checks for style guide compliance

4. **Team Features**
   - Implement team-specific permissions
   - Add team management interface
   - Test team invitation flow
