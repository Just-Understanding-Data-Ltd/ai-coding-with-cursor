## Key Learnings

1. **Testing Infrastructure**

   - Factory-based testing patterns for organizations and team members
   - TDD approach refinement
   - Integration test best practices
   - React Query testing patterns

2. **Organization Management**

   - CRUD operation implementation
   - Error handling patterns
   - Workspace management
   - Authentication flow integration

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Direct PostgreSQL vs Supabase API patterns
   - Factory approach for auth testing
   - Email uniqueness handling
   - Database reset strategies

## Key Achievements

1. **Testing Infrastructure**

   - Implemented factory-based testing infrastructure
   - Created comprehensive TDD approach documentation
   - Enhanced auth tests with unique email generation
   - Fixed database reset functionality

2. **Feature Development**

   - Implemented createOrganization with CRUD operations
   - Updated workspace redirects
   - Added disabled state to workspace card
   - Improved error handling

3. **Documentation**
   - Added React Query hook documentation
   - Updated TDD approach rules
   - Documented testing patterns and best practices

## Today's Commits in Order

1. `feat(organizations)`: Implement createOrganization and associated CRUD operations
2. `feat(testing)`: Implement factory-based testing infrastructure
3. `docs`: Update TDD approach rules with testing patterns
4. `docs`: Add react-query hook documentation
5. `refactor`: Update workspace redirects and add disabled state
6. `test(integration)`: Refactor auth tests with factory approach
7. `fix`: Working on integration tests
8. `fix(integration)`: Resolve reset_test_db execution

## Key Challenges and How They Were Overcome

1. **Testing Infrastructure**

   - Challenge: Complex test setup and maintenance
   - Solution: Implemented factory-based approach for consistent test data

2. **Authentication Testing**

   - Challenge: Email conflicts in tests
   - Solution: Implemented unique email generation in factory approach

3. **Database Management**
   - Challenge: Unreliable test database reset
   - Solution: Implemented direct PostgreSQL connection for maintenance

## Key Next Steps

1. Continue expanding factory-based testing patterns
2. Implement additional organization management features
3. Enhance error handling and user feedback
4. Document new testing patterns and best practices
5. Review and optimize workspace management
6. Consider creating helper functions for common database tasks
