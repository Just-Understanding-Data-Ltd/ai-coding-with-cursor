## Key learnings

### React Query and Data Fetching

- Established proper React Query setup in `apps/web/lib/react-query.ts`
- Using TypeScript for strongly-typed query results and error handling
- Implementing proper loading states with React Query's `isLoading` and `isFetching` states

### Supabase Integration

- Using three distinct Supabase clients for different purposes:
  ```typescript
  // apps/web/utils/supabase/
  -supabaseAdminClient(admin.ts) -
    supabaseClient(client.ts) -
    supabaseServerClient(server.ts);
  ```
- Avoiding next-auth-helpers package in favor of custom Supabase implementation

### Dashboard Architecture

- Implementing dynamic routing with TypeScript-safe params:
  ```typescript
  // Example from dashboard/[orgId]/page.tsx
  export default async function Page({
    params,
  }: {
    params: Promise<{ orgId: string }>;
  }) {
    const { orgId } = await params;
    // ... rest of implementation
  }
  ```
- Using proper error boundaries with dedicated error.tsx files
- Implementing loading skeletons for better UX

### Type Safety

- Strong focus on TypeScript types across the monorepo
- Custom type definitions in packages/supabase/src/types.ts
- Database type safety with database.types.ts and database-functions.types.ts

## Key achievements

1. Set up proper monorepo structure with Turborepo
2. Implemented type-safe Supabase integration
3. Established dashboard routing with proper error handling
4. Created reusable components with proper TypeScript types

## Key challenges and how they were overcome

1. **Dynamic Route Type Safety**

   - Solved by properly typing params as Promises
   - Implemented proper async/await patterns

2. **Supabase Integration**

   - Created separate client instances for different use cases
   - Established clear patterns for server vs client usage

3. **Loading States**
   - Implemented dedicated loading skeleton components
   - Used React Query's built-in loading states effectively

## Key next steps

1. Continue building out dashboard features
2. Implement more comprehensive error handling
3. Add proper test coverage for components
4. Document component patterns and usage
5. Optimize bundle sizes and performance
