## Key Learnings

1. **React Query Hydration Flow**

   - Server-side prefetching with `prefetchQuery`
   - Dehydration of query client state
   - Client-side hydration using `HydrationBoundary`
   - Importance of matching query keys

2. **Mutation Patterns**

   - Proper mutation function structure
   - Handling success/error states
   - Cache updates after mutations
   - Return types and data flow

3. **Best Practices**

   - Query client instance management
   - Error handling strategies
   - TypeScript integration
   - Performance considerations

4. **Reusable Patterns**
   - Creating factory functions for queries and mutations
   - Standardized error handling with toasts
   - Integration with React Suspense
   - Error boundary implementation

## Key Achievements

1. Implemented basic React Query setup with server-side hydration
2. Created reusable patterns for handling queries and mutations
3. Established best practices for error handling and notifications
4. Set up type-safe query key management

## Key Challenges and How They Were Overcome

1. **Hydration Understanding**

   - Challenge: Understanding where hydration should occur
   - Solution: Clarified that `HydrationBoundary` must be client-side

2. **Type Safety**

   - Challenge: Managing types for dehydrated state
   - Solution: Focused on typing query functions and data structures instead of over-engineering

3. **Error Handling**
   - Challenge: Consistent error handling across queries/mutations
   - Solution: Created reusable patterns with toast notifications and error boundaries

## Key Next Steps

1. Implement the reusable patterns in actual features:

   - Create query/mutation factories
   - Set up error boundaries
   - Implement toast notifications

2. Add advanced features:

   - Optimistic updates
   - Infinite queries
   - Parallel queries
   - Dependent queries

3. Performance optimization:
   - Configure proper stale times
   - Implement selective query invalidation
   - Add proper suspense boundaries
