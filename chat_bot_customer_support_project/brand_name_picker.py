I need brand names that are unique and work well for the entire brand, rather than a feature led name?

Here are some examples:
Generic Names

* Socialpulse
* ContentCompass
* 

Names

* ReplyDeck
* CommentFlow
* RelateFlow
* Replywise

Remix these words like social, compass, deck, relate, reply, wise and other synconms

The core jobs to be done is managing lots of clients and doing great work for those clients, i.e. content strategy, creating content and publishing content.
