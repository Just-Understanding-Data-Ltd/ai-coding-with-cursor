# Workspaces Feature PRD

## Overview

The workspaces feature provides a central hub for users to view, manage, and switch between their team workspaces. This is a critical navigation component that helps users manage their team contexts.

## User Stories

### Core Functionality

1. As a user, I want to see all teams I'm a member of
2. As a user, I want to create new workspaces (if I have permission)
3. As a user, I want to manage workspace settings (if I have permission)
4. As a user, I want to be redirected to the correct workspace context

### Permission-Based Stories

#### Team Admin

- Create new workspaces
- Manage workspace settings
- Delete workspaces
- Manage team members

#### Team Member

- View available workspaces
- Access workspace content
- View team members

#### Client Admin

- Same permissions as Team Admin but only for my organization

#### Client Member

- Same permissions as Team Member but only for my organization

```

### Data Flow

1. Page Load:

```typescript
// Fetch teams and permissions
const workspaces = useTeams({ organizationId, supabase });
const permissions = useWorkspacePermissions({ userId, orgId });
```

2. Workspace Creation:

```typescript
// Create workspace flow
const { mutate: createWorkspace } = useCreateTeam({
  supabase,
  options: {
    onSuccess: (team) => {
      router.push(`/org/${orgId}/${team.id}`);
    },
  },
});
```

### Integration Tests

```typescript
describe("Workspaces Feature", () => {
  describe("Team Admin", () => {
    it("should see create workspace button");
    it("should be able to create new workspace");
    it("should be able to manage workspace settings");
    it("should be able to delete workspace");
  });

  describe("Team Member", () => {
    it("should not see create workspace button");
    it("should see all available workspaces");
    it("should be able to view workspace details");
  });

  describe("Client Admin", () => {
    it("should only see organization workspaces");
    it("should have same permissions as team admin within org");
  });

  describe("Client Member", () => {
    it("should only see organization workspaces");
    it("should have same permissions as team member within org");
  });
});
```

## UI Components

### WorkspaceCard

```typescript
interface CreateWorkspaceModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  organizationId: string;
}
```

## Permission Matrix

| Action           | Team Admin | Team Member | Client Admin | Client Member |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| View Workspaces  | ✅         | ✅          | ✅ (Org)     | ✅ (Org)      |
| Create Workspace | ✅         | ❌          | ✅ (Org)     | ❌            |
| Manage Settings  | ✅         | ❌          | ✅ (Org)     | ❌            |
| Delete Workspace | ✅         | ❌          | ✅ (Org)     | ❌            |
| View Members     | ✅         | ✅          | ✅ (Org)     | ✅ (Org)      |

## Implementation Plan

1. Core Components

   - WorkspaceCard component with role-based actions
   - WorkspaceGrid for layout
   - CreateWorkspaceModal for new workspace flow

2. Data Layer

   - Implement useWorkspaces hook
   - Add workspace permissions hook
   - Create server actions for CRUD operations

3. Integration

   - Add role-based routing
   - Implement workspace switching
   - Add error boundaries

4. Testing
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for user flows
   - Permission-based test cases

## Success Metrics

- All test cases pass
- Correct role-based access
- Successful workspace creation flow
- Proper error handling
- Type safety across all components

## Next Steps

1. Implement base components
2. Add integration tests
3. Build server actions
4. Add permission hooks
5. Implement UI components
