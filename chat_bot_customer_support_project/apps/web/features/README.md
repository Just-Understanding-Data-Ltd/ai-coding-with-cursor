## Features

Features are well defined components, server actions, CRUD operations, hooks and other business logic to ship a single feature. These features are relatively isolated components and are not meant to be reused across the application.

The folders within a feature folder:

- `actions`: server actions
- `components`: React components
- `hooks`: React hooks
- `types`: TypeScript types
- `utils`: Utility functions

Also you will find `page.tsx` which is the main entry point for the feature.
