You must summarise the progress of a chat session and make a new file for the day which is formatted with DD-MM-YYYY.md format.

You must find out the date by running a linux command because your default date is not accurate.

Focus on the following:

- Key learnings, this should have code examples and explanations.
- Key achievements
- Key challenges and how they were overcome
- Next steps

The file should be formatted as a markdown file with the following structure:

# DD-MM-YYYY

## Key learnings

## Key achievements

## Key challenges and how they were overcome

## Key next steps

You must store this new .md within the `_project_progress` folder at the root level of the repository.

If a .md already exists for the day, you must append/edit the existing file.
